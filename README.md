Homework Exercise: 90's Style Website
Complete & Submit the Exercise
Create a basic website!

Start with the home page at index.html
Create pages for individual topics.
These can your interest, passions, family, cats, or anything else.
Link the different pages to one another (via nav or links in the content).
Include images.
Make use of tags you learned.
Make use of CSS styling.
Host your site on github pages.
Make 5-10 different pages.
Put good content in them.
A few ideas:

Document a few of the python projects you created with screenshots, pre-formatted code, and a brief description.
Create a hypertext version of notes you've taken during class, including links to external resources.
Create a (hopefully non-creepy) fan page for something you love.

Though we will explore more HTML and CSS in upcoming lessons, don't be afraid to use tags and styles we haven't gone over!
